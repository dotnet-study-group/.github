## General Tips

Make real projects: Don't limit yourself to exercises. Create something useful.
Learn to debug: Use the Visual Studio debugger.
Practice every day: 30 minutes a day are more effective than 3 hours once a week.
Don't get overwhelmed: Prioritize topics according to your interests (web, mobile, games, etc.).
